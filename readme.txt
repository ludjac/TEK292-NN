The main files: maineye1.m & maineye2.m contains scripts for running
eyeblink1.m resp. eyeblink2.m. They contain answers to the questions as the
are asked and also produce plots to further illustrate the situations.

Thanks for a nice exercise. Looking forward to building bigger neural networks
in the future :)
